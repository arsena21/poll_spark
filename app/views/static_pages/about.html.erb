  <strong>If the World wants change...will those in power provide it? </strong>
    <br><br>
  ChangeByFive is a non-profit corporation, operating out of Canada. 
  We are a platform for change, here to give the people of the world a voice. ChangeByFive is defined by
  our focused efforts, our numbers and Five.
  <br><br>
   <b><i>Focus.</i></b> We are here to raise the most pressing issues of our time. All of us might have 
  different thoughts on what is most important. But say we had to choose. Say we had to 
  decide - what would you change? ChangebyFive allows users to vote for topics they feel are important. 
  Each user has Five votes which they can distribute in any way they choose. After 6 months, the most popular
topic is launched as a campaign.  ChangeByFive opted to have only one campaign every six months is simple. By focusing our efforts,
we will drastically increase our chances of success and give a clear message to our leaders that we, the people, 
are ready for change. 

  <br><br>
 <b><i>Numbers.</i></b> ChangeByFive has a goal of reaching every single person in North America.
 We live in a democracy. Lets show our leaders that we do care. That we do have a voice. 
    <br><br>
	 <b><i>Five.</i></b>  Five is our request. To change the world is no small task, and we ask that every person share
	 each campaign with Five individuals, two of which must not use social networks frequently. Five was chosen 
	 quite arbitrarily, although the number Five has a nice ring to it. 
    <br><br>
  We are ChangeByFive...Changing the world, Five at a time.
